The code is to visualize the performance of Single-object Grasp Planning.
We refer dexnet(https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/)

The installation method is the same with dexnet (https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/install/install.html)

## Case 1: Show all the major grasps

## Case 2: Show the supplementary grasps
(The blue grasp denotes the major grasp and the rest are supplementary grasps)
